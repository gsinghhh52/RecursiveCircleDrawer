This JavaFX project is a simple recursive circle drawer. When the user enters a number into the text field and clicks "Start," the program draws a series of circles centered on the pane. Each circle is 10 pixels smaller in radius than the last, and the colors alternate between red and blue. The program uses recursion to draw the circles instead of a loop. If the entered radius is too large to fit in the window, an alert box is shown. This project was created for a Java class assignment and demonstrates the use of JavaFX, layout panes, user input handling, and recursion in drawing shapes.
